# RAIN

Arduino library for rain sensor (analog).


## Description

The RAIN sensor is a relative simple device. 
It measures the resistance of a number of wires when these are put un a liquid (water)
The device converts that resistance to a voltage 0..VCC - typical 5V.
The more the wires are covered by the liquid, the higher the voltage.

Furthermore the breakout I used to test had a digital output, which becomes HIGH if a certain
threshold (to be set with a potentiometer) was reached.
The meaning / potential of this digi-out for the library is not clear yet.

The library is EXPERIMENTAL as it needs more testing. 
(changes of the interface are possible).


## Interface

- **RAIN(uint8_t port)** constructor. 
port is the internal analog port to use.
- **bool  begin(float maxVoltage, uint16_t maxSteps)** sets the ADC parameters. 
Allows to be changed runtime, e.g. if voltage fluctuates the math can be adapted by calling **begin()** again. 
Might be a separate **setVoltage()** is more efficient.
- **float read(uint8_t times = 1)** makes 1 or more measurements, averages them and convert the average to a voltage.
- **float percentage()** returns the last **read()** to a percentage.
Note one needs to call read() again to get a new value as this uses a cached value.


#### MultiMap

One might use the **MultiMap** library to map the voltage read to some
other, more useful unit.
See https://github.com/RobTillaart/MultiMap


## Operation

The examples show the basic working of the functions.


## Future

#### Must
- update documentation
  - a lot, 
  - links etc.
- test more
  - different salinity
  - different liquids? which?
  - how linear is the device?

#### Should
- investigate "a scale of wetness"
- add unit-tests
- add examples.
- add calibration some sort, so people can map e.g. depth on voltage?
- output as percentage?
- investigate possibilities of the digital output 
  - how to include
- **float readExt(float val)** for extern ADC


#### Could


#### Won't
